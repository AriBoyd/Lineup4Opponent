AI to play Line Up 4/Connect 4 as optimally as possible

Line Up 4, or Connect 4, is a game played in a 6 by 7 grid. Each of the two players takes their turn by placing a token into one of the grid's columns, in the lowest empty space. If at any point one player's tokens form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of 4, that player wins the game. If all available spaces are filled, but no lines of 4 are made, then the game is said to be a tie.

Note that while Line Up 4 has been solved, it still provides a useful game to demonstrate AI agents, as it is fully observable and has a large but reasonable state space.
